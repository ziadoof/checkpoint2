            <ol>
                <li>Your code has to respect good practices and especially PSR-1 and PSR-2. <em>N.B.: Codesniffer is
                        registered as a dev dependency in this project.</em></li>
                <li>You have to push your code on this project repository. Do it on a branch with your firstname and
                    lastname as *Arthur_DUPOND*. Think about atomic commits
                </li>
                <li>All the app is already designed. Focus on code, not decoration !
                    If you really <strong>need</strong> to change something in Twig, of course, you can.
                </li>
                <li>You work for yourself, if you need help, you can ask to your trainer.</li>

            <h2>1. Algorithm exercise</h2>
            <p>In <samp>src/Service/String.php</samp> you have to write code wich have the same behavior as PHP native
                function <samp>ltrim()</samp>.
                In PHP manual, it's described as :
            <blockquote cite="http://php.net/manual/en/function.ltrim.php">
                <strong>ltrim</strong> â€” Strip whitespace (or other characters) from the beginning of a string
                <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.ltrim.php" target="_blank">see more</a>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                All your code must be contained in <samp>trimWhiteSpaces()</samp> method.
                You are not allowed to use regular expressions and of course
                <em>you can't use <samp>ltrim()</samp> function itself and all of trim familly as
                    <samp>trim()</samp>.</em>
                In this checkpoint we only want you to code the basic usage of this function :
                <strong>removing useless white spaces before a string.</strong>. So ignore the second optionnal
                parameter of the native ltrim function.
                When you'll want to test your code, you can run in command lines :
                <code class="block">
                    ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Service/StringToolsTest
                </code>
                If all tests are OK, you can consider your mission acomplished.
                You can commit your work and push it on your remote branch.

            <h2>2. Application development</h2>
            Your next mission is to finish the back end part of a Star Wars Wiki. Main routes are availables from the
            burger menu in navbar above.
            You can read instructions below to know what we are expecting from you :
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <del>A page which display all beasts from data base. All list items display a link to the beast's
                        details page.
                    </del>
                    <em>Already done !</em>
                </li>
                <li>A page which displays all details of a specific beast, with all information about him :
                    everything contained in the beast table.
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/join.html">#joins</a>
                </li>
                <li>The details page also have to display the planet where she/he comes from and in which movies she/he
                    can be seen. Those information are contained in other tables.
                </li>
                <li>A creation page where your can add a new beast, and give informations about : the planet where
                    she/he comes from, movies where she/he can be seen.
                </li>
                <li>An edition page where your can edit a selected beast, and update informations about : the planet
                    where
                    she/he comes from, movies where she/he can be seen.
                </li>
                <li>On the edition page, you can find a delete button, which allow you to remove a beast from the
                    database.
                </li>
                <li>On creation page, planets list and movies list are coming from database.
                    <em>You're right, a beast could be seen in multiple movies. But in this exercice we allow only one movie per beast.</em>
                </li>
                <li>A page which display all planets from database.</li>
                <li>A page which display all movies from database.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you want to test if all routes are OK, you can try the code below. Your favorite trainer will use this
                to check if all routes are working :
                <code class="block">
                    ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/AppTest.php
                </code>
            </p>
